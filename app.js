// STEP 1 ‚Äî Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com/
// STEP 2 ‚Äî In your Supabase dashboard:
//   - Create a table called "listeners" with columns:

//       soundwalk_id (int8)
//       listener_name (text)
//       created_at (timestamp, default: now())
//   - Go to Table Editor > "listeners" > enable Row Level Security (RLS)
//   - Create a policy: ‚ÄúEnable insert and read access for all users‚Äù
//       ‚Üí for select & insert, use: `true`
//   - Copy your project URL and public anon key
// STEP 3 ‚Äî Paste them below:
