            <h2>Group Project 2: Sonic Signals and Futures (35% total)</h2>
            <p>Working in teams of 2, you will choose one of two streams below and create an original composition that
                explores sonic culture in innovative ways. Your project should engage with readings and topics from
                weeks 7–10.</p>

            <p><strong>Stream A – The Body as Instrument:</strong> Explore how personal bio-data can generate unique
                sonic experiences that reflect movement, gesture, and the physicality of the body. You will collect your
                own GPS data using Strava, an app and online platform for tracking physical activity. You may also use
                wearable devices (e.g., Apple Watch, Fitbit) to collect heart rate data. This data will then be sonified
                using an online sequencer to create experimental musical outcomes.

                    style="color: #fff; text-decoration: underline;">Explore Strava</a>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Stream B – Creative Music Machines:</strong> Explore how artificial intelligence tools can help
                you generate music. Using the online tool ElevenLabs, you will produce a music composition from
                elaborate
                text prompts. To create your composition, you will use other AI tools like ChatGPT to collaborate in an
                interactive,
                co-creative process to produce music.

            <h3>Overall Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>By completing this project, students will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create experimental sound compositions:</strong> Develop technical proficiency in
                    collecting, manipulating, and composing sound using personal bio-data/bio-signals and AI tools to
                    produce
                    original artwork that explores new sonic possibilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborate effectively in creative contexts:</strong> Work productively with partners to
                    synthesize individual ideas into cohesive artistic work, while providing and integrating
                    constructive peer feedback throughout the creative process.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect artistic practice to theoretical frameworks:</strong> Analyze how sound-based art
                    can illuminate theoretical ideas about sound, embodiment, and technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect critically on creative learning:</strong> Articulate creative decisions, evaluate
                    different artistic approaches, and analyze personal development throughout the project process using
                    clear written and oral communication.</li>

                            <li><strong>Stream A – The Body as Instrument:</strong>
                                Describe a physical activity involving a route that you plan to
                                record using the <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank"

                                Explain how you imagine transforming the GPS data into music — for example, what types
                                of sounds or instruments might represent your heartbeat, speed, or movement?
                                Mention how your idea connects to course discussions on embodiment, sound, and
                                technology, drawing from ideas in the readings about biosignal-driven art, affective
                                feedback, and the body as a site of musical expression.

                                Outline the general musical sections you envision (e.g., intro, verse, chorus, bridge,
                                outro). Indicate whether your composition will include lyrics — if so, will you write
                                them
                                yourself or use AI generation? Discuss how your concept relates to course themes of
                                automation, creativity, and human–machine collaboration, referencing ideas from the
                                readings on algorithmic composition, AI-generated music, and the remixing of digital
                                sound cultures.

                            <li>A short audio or visual sketch representing your idea. For example, you can submit the

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stream A</strong> — test your CSV formatting and experiment with different CSV→MIDI
                            mapping options (pitch range, velocity mapping from speed/heartbeat, time scaling). Use
                            Online Sequencer to layer additional instrumentation and refine arrangement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stream B</strong> — iterate prompts, keep records of variations, and consider
                            post-processing AI output (EQ, layering, human input) to shape a cohesive composition. If
                            using generated vocals, check clarity and intelligibility before finalizing.</li>
                        <li>Keep backups of all original data, MIDI files, prompts, and project versions — you will
                            include these in your materials folder.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>

                        <li>How your materials and technical process were used in the final composition (CSV→MIDI steps,
                            sequencing choices, prompt strategies, AI interventions)</li>
                        <li>Connections to course readings and themes from Weeks 7–10 (cite at least 1–2 readings, e.g.,
                            Ortiz on biosignal art, McLean & Dean on algorithmic music, White on AI and creativity)</li>

                        <li>Aim for a clear beginning, development, and ending across 2–4 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Balance experimental gestures (data-driven textures, algorithmic quirks) with musical
                            clarity so listeners can follow the piece.</li>
                        <li>Document any places where you intervened heavily (manual editing, added instruments, human
                            performance) so assessors can see how you shaped raw data/AI output into art.</li>

                    <p>
                        The exhibition will take the form of a <strong>project fair</strong>. Half of the teams will set
                        up at designated booths with their laptops or devices to showcase their compositions, along with
                        any associated data or visual elements. During the first hour, the other half of the class will
                        circulate among the booths, explore the projects, and take notes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the first hour, the teams will switch roles: those who were circulating will now take the
                        booths to present their work, while the first group circulates to explore and observe new
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fair will be followed by a brief classroom discussion to share reflections and highlight
                        insights from the exhibition.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Exhibition Participation</h3>

                        <li>Specific observations about what worked well conceptually and sonically</li>
                        <li>Concrete suggestions for improving clarity, creativity, or integration of data, biofeedback,
                            or AI elements</li>
                        <li>Questions about creative choices, compositional structure, or presentation</li>

                        <li>How did the use of body data (Stream A) or AI tools (Stream B) contribute to the creative
                            outcome?</li>
                        <li>Were the audio and any supporting visual/data elements integrated cohesively?</li>
                        <li>How did the work make you think differently about sound, embodiment, or machine
                            collaboration?</li>
                        <li>What specific adjustments could enhance clarity, creativity, or impact?</li>
