            <h2>Group Project 1: The Sound of Everyday Life (35% total)</h2>
            <p>Working in pairs (2 people), you will create a soundwalk for a site or path at Stratford School that
                reveals how
                people move through and experience that space. You should connect your soundwalk topic to topics and
                readings from
                weeks 1-4.</p>

            <p><strong>What is a soundwalk?</strong> A soundwalk is a form of active listening that focuses on the
                acoustic environment of a specific location or route. Participants walk through a space while paying
                particular attention to the sounds around them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundwalk"

            <h3>Overall Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>By completing this project, students will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create site-specific sound art:</strong> Develop technical proficiency in field recording,
                    audio editing, and location-based technology to produce original artwork that reveals
                    new perspectives on familiar spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborate effectively in creative contexts:</strong> Work productively with partners to
                    synthesize individual concepts into cohesive artistic work, while providing and integrating
                    constructive peer feedback throughout the creative process.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect artistic practice to theoretical frameworks:</strong> Analyze how sound-based art
                    can illuminate theoretical ideas about space, sound, and everyday experience.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reflect critically on creative learning:</strong> Articulate creative decisions, evaluate
                    different artistic approaches, and analyze personal development throughout the project process using
                    clear written and oral communication.</li>

                soundwalk should be a cohesive composition that reveals how people move
                through and experience a chosen site or path near Stratford School. Your soundwalk should connect to
                topics and readings from weeks 1-4. </p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        Individually, gather sound materials based on their Part 1 proposal concept. Your collection can
                        be made up of original field recordings, archival materials, or a combination of both. The goal
                        is to build an audio palette that reflects your proposed site or path near Stratford School and
                        connects to the themes of everyday life. In Part 3, you and your partner will decide which
                        proposal
                        and materials to use for your final soundwalk.

                            move through and experience a chosen site near Stratford School. Your soundwalk should
                            connect to
                            topics and readings from weeks 1-4.

                    <p><strong>300-500 words</strong> addressing the following points: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How your final concept developed from the proposal stage (which proposal did you choose
                            and
                            why?)</li>
                        <li>Where the sounds came from (recordings, archives, online sources, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Why these specific sounds were chosen and how they connect to the site</li>
                        <li>How your soundwalk connects to topics and readings from week 1 - 4</li>
                        <li>Creative decisions and any challenges encountered</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Additional Tips on Audio Recodings</h4>
                    <p>Reflect how can you create complex or layered audio recordings that get the audience immersed
                        (i.e., involved deeply) in the space? Ask yourself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do your sounds stand out from the live environment? Do they guide the listenerâ€™s attention?
                        </li>
                        <li>Which unique sounds or locations can help express your theme better?</li>
                        <li>Are there narrative choices that will make your soundwalk memorable?</li>
                        <li>What other connections to course readings can enhance your project?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><strong>If your audio recordings blend in too much, consider layering multiple sounds or adding
                            narration using your voice or text-to-speech to create a richer experience</strong>.</li>

                    After experiencing each soundwalk, provide constructive oral feedback to the
                    presenting team focusing on:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Specific observations about what worked well</li>
                        <li>Concrete suggestions for improvement</li>
                        <li>Questions about creative choices or technical decisions</li>
                        <li>Connections to course themes and concepts</li>
                    </ul>



                    <h4>Example Feedback Prompts</h4>

                    Use these prompts to guide your constructive feedback:

                    <ul>
                        <li>What aspects of the soundwalk did you find most engaging or thought-provoking?</li>
                        <li>How did the sound selection contribute to your experience of the site?</li>
                        <li>Were the transitions between sounds smooth? Did they create a cohesive journey?</li>
                        <li>How did the soundwalk make you think differently about this space?
                            (Even if the change feels small, try to notice new details, perspectives, or feelings you
                            may not have considered before.)</li>
                        <li>What specific improvements or adjustments would enhance the experience?</li>
                        <li>How effectively did the work connect to course themes from weeks 1-4?</li>
                    </ul>
